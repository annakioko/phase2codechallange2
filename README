#BOT BATTLR WEB APP
Welcome to Bot Battlr, the ultimate destination for assembling your very own Bot Army! This React application allows you to browse through a list of available robots, view their details, and enlist them into your army.

#OVERVIEW
Bot Battlr is a React-based web application developed to showcase proficiency in implementing components, props, state management, event handling, and data fetching. The project aims to provide users with a seamless experience in managing their Bot Army, from browsing available bots to enlisting them for battle.

#FEATURES
